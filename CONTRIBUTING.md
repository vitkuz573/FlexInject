## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [FlexInject Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [vitkuz573@gmail.com](mailto:vitkuz573@gmail.com).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/vitkuz573/FlexInject/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A Good Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](https://github.com/vitkuz573) your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as much detail as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancements are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](https://github.com/vitkuz573) your enhancement is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the enhancement.
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as much detail as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.

### Pull Requests

- **Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bugfix.**
- **Write a good commit message.**
- **Pull Requests should be created against the `develop` branch.**
- **Do not create a pull request unless you have tested your changes.**

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or fewer.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### C# Styleguide

- Follow the [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions).
